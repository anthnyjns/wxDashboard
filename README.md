# wxDashboard

wxDash is the beginning of a project to create a dashboard for the local weather forecast in the Austin area. The project will be completed in steps as time permits.

Step 1: We start with a layout that stores static results from a previous project and allows us to insert some formatting and transition between views.

Step 2: Swap out some of the static pages with results from URL requests to display current forecasts.

Step 3: Set up create a database to store historical data for later use. We'll use some automated queries to pull forecasts and actual weather information at regular intervals for comparison.

Step 4: Add some KPIs to start grading our forecasts.
